# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Avoid changing of any file names (useles since this is an open source library) but keep shrinking
# the class files to reduce the size of the library package.

-dontobfuscate

# Prevent removing the entry points of the library while performing shrinking.
